# Developer Notes (by Tyler Liu)

## Phone number format

When you use the demo application, make sure that you enter the phone number format as '6501234567', not '(650) 123-4567'.
Otherwise outbound call doesn't work.

When you call a foreign number, it's a good idea to add prefix '+', for example: +61123456789
